# Portfolio Dashboard Security Guide

## 🔒 Security Best Practices Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Token-based authentication with Django REST Framework
- ✅ Role-based permissions (Admin/Public)
- ✅ Secure password requirements
- ✅ Session timeout handling
- ✅ Proper logout token invalidation

### API Security
- ✅ Rate limiting (50 requests/hour for anonymous, 500 for authenticated)
- ✅ Contact form rate limiting (10 submissions/hour)
- ✅ CORS properly configured (no wildcard origins)
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ SQL injection protection (Django ORM)
- ✅ XSS protection with content sanitization

### Infrastructure Security
- ✅ HTTPS enforcement in production
- ✅ Security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- ✅ Environment variables for sensitive data
- ✅ Debug mode disabled in production
- ✅ Allowed hosts restriction

### Data Protection
- ✅ Sensitive data encryption at rest
- ✅ Secure token storage
- ✅ Personal information access control
- ✅ Contact message privacy

## ⚠️ Security Checklist for Production

### Before Deployment:
- [ ] Set strong SECRET_KEY in environment variables
- [ ] Set DEBUG=False
- [ ] Configure proper ALLOWED_HOSTS
- [ ] Set CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS=False
- [ ] Set strong PORTFOLIO_ADMIN_PASSWORD
- [ ] Enable HTTPS and security headers
- [ ] Configure proper database (PostgreSQL recommended)
- [ ] Set up proper backup strategy
- [ ] Configure monitoring and logging

### Regular Maintenance:
- [ ] Update dependencies regularly
- [ ] Monitor access logs
- [ ] Review and rotate admin passwords
- [ ] Check for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Monitor rate limiting effectiveness
- [ ] Review contact form submissions

## 🚨 Security Incidents Response

### If you suspect a security breach:
1. Immediately change admin passwords
2. Revoke all authentication tokens
3. Check access logs for suspicious activity
4. Update all dependencies
5. Review database for unauthorized changes
6. Enable additional monitoring

### Contact Form Spam Protection:
- Rate limiting: 10 submissions per hour
- IP-based tracking
- Content validation and sanitization
- Admin-only message access

## 🔧 Security Configuration Files

### Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=yourdomain.com
CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS=False
PORTFOLIO_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
```

### HTTPS Configuration
- SSL/TLS certificate installation
- HTTP to HTTPS redirect
- HSTS headers
- Secure cookie settings

## 📊 Security Monitoring

### Logs to Monitor:
- Authentication attempts
- Rate limit violations
- Contact form submissions
- Admin access patterns
- API endpoint usage

### Alerts to Set Up:
- Multiple failed login attempts
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Contact form spam attempts
- Security header violations

## 🛡️ Additional Recommendations

### For Enhanced Security:
1. **Database Security**: Use PostgreSQL with proper user permissions
2. **Backup Strategy**: Regular encrypted backups
3. **CDN Usage**: Use CDN for static assets with proper security headers
4. **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
5. **Updates**: Keep all dependencies up to date
6. **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments

### For Development:
1. Never commit secrets to version control
2. Use separate environments for dev/staging/production
3. Regular security code reviews
4. Dependency vulnerability scanning
5. Use security linters and static analysis tools
